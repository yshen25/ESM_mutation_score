# ESM-MutScan Toolkit
Score protein sequences using ESM based methods, including zero shot and few shot modes with multiple methods

A modular pipeline for:
- Embedding sequences with HuggingFace ESM models
- Generating single/double mutants
- Performing zero-shot mutation scoring
- Training and applying ML models on ESM embeddings

---

## ðŸ§± Components

- `embed_sequences.py`: embed sequences from CSV
- `ml_train.py`: train regressors on ESM embeddings
- `predict_affinity.py`: score new sequences
- `run_mutscan.py`: scan mutants and filter for improved ESM scores
- `find_max_batch.py`: detect max GPU-safe batch size

---
